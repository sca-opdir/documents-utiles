### Posts

* Add, update or remove a post in the *Posts* collection.

### Post Series

To add a tutorial/post to a series:
* Add a `set` field to the tutorial front matter which points to the file name of the desired set without the `.md` extention. e.g. If I have a set at `_sets/getting-started.md` I would use this in my tutorial front matter: `set: getting-started`.
* Add a `order_number` field to the tutorial front matter and specify a number. This is the tutorials order in the set.
